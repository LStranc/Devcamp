      <p>I have just started coding this year and it has been a great experience for me.
      It allows you to think outside of the box and work hard. There are so many different
      ways that coding can help you in the future. I would definitely recomend that every
      person should get to take some type of coding class in their life.</p>
      
      <p>Eventhough I do love coding, I am also interested in many other things. I've been playing the piano,
      saxophone and clarinet for about 3 years. I love to watch and play almost all sports (except baseball).
      Then there is the part of me that wants to learn new things. I always want to learn and get good 
      at new skills. Thats why I decided to take this course over my summer vacation. In the end, I am just 
      extremely greatfull to have this experience and I hope you enjoy this site!
