        <h2> Why People Should Code</h2>
        <p>I have just started coding this year and it has been a great experience fo me.
        It allows you to think outside of the box and work hard. There are so many different
        ways that coding can help you in the future. I would definitely recomend that every
        person should get to take some type of coding class in their life.</p>
        
        <h2> A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>Eventhough I love to code and am looking forward to getting to learn more in the future,
        I have many other interests. I have been playing the saxophone, piano, and bass clarinet
        for over 3 years. I have always had a love for watching and playing sports (except baseball).
        Most of all, I have always had a desire to want to learn as much as I can which has lead me 
        to this course. Anyways, in the end I would like to thank my family for giving  me the chance
        to do this and just all the people that could make it happen. I am blessed to
        live in a time like this and I am greatful that Botega gave me this chance.</p>
