<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have just started coding this year and it has been a great experience fo me.
It allows you to think outside of the box and work hard. There are so many different
ways that coding can help you in the future. I would definitely recomend that every
person should get to take some type of coding class in their life.</p>
